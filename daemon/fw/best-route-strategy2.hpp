/** \brief Best Route strategy version 4
 *
 *  This strategy forwards a new Interest to the lowest-cost nexthop (except downstream).
 *  After that, if consumer retransmits the Interest (and is not suppressed according to
 *  exponential backoff algorithm), the strategy forwards the Interest again to
 *  the lowest-cost nexthop (except downstream) that is not previously used.
 *  If all nexthops have been used, the strategy starts over with the first nexthop.
 *
 *  This strategy returns Nack to all downstreams with reason NoRoute
 *  if there is no usable nexthop, which may be caused by:
 *  (a) the FIB entry contains no nexthop;
 *  (b) the FIB nexthop happens to be the sole downstream;
 *  (c) the FIB nexthops violate scope.
 *
 *  This strategy returns Nack to all downstreams if all upstreams have returned Nacks.
 *  The reason of the sent Nack equals the least severe reason among received Nacks.
